- added worker wire messages `PAUSE` (`t=12`) and `RESUME` (`t=13`) with queue-name payload (`p.q`)
- enforced queue-state validation (`PAUSE` only for running queues, `RESUME` only for paused queues)
- restricted `PAUSE`/`RESUME` to non-system queues (`_`-prefixed queues are rejected)
- refactored worker queue existence checks in runtime handlers into reusable helpers
- updated wire protocol draft and module docs for new queue-state messages
