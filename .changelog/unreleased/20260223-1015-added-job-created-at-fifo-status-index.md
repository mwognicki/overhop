- enriched jobs with immutable `created_at` persistence metadata wiring in transient->storage flow
- extended storage upsert contract with `created_at_ms` and added sled status FIFO index key ordered by `created_at` (big-endian sortable bytes)
- added storage API/test coverage for status-scoped FIFO UUID listing (`list_job_uuids_by_status_fifo`)
- updated storage/jobs/LLM context docs to reflect created-at and FIFO keying rules
