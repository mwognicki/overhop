- added heartbeat-bound persisted job status progression: `new` -> (`waiting`|`delayed`) and `delayed` -> `waiting` based on execution start time
- added storage status-index query API to find jobs by current status for progression updates
- ensured each status transition is persisted immediately by updating both primary job record and status key
- added storage test coverage for status index queries and updates
